Hi Abhitej,

     My name is Abhitej, and I’m studying Computer Science & Statistics at Rutgers University. I was on LinkedIn, came across this Yahoo internship: https://ouryahoo.wd5.myworkdayjobsx.com/en-US/careers/details/Yahoo-Fantasy-Sports-Android-Engineer_JR0023624 and was super interested in this opportunity. I reached out by email because I feel my skills & interests align heavily and this is an opportunity I don't want to pass up on.

Can you put me in touch with a recruiter for this position to get an opportunity to interview?


I'd love to be considered and am a great fit for 3 reasons: 

 - I worked at Yahoo last summer as a DevSecOps Intern on their cybersecurity team. I created Slack Automations with Python & AWS and debugged software that helped manage EKS clusters.

 - I’ve worked at ADP as a Software Engineer Intern on their insurance team. I used Java and Oracle SQL to optimize legacy APIs and Angular to create client summary dashboards.

 - I channel my passion in computer science through the Rutgers Mobile App Development Club and participate in hackathons, winning prizes with my project Schwordle: https://devpost.com/software/schwordle 


I’d love to speak with you via Zoom or a 10-minute phone call if you are free next week to discuss about these opportunities.

Please check out my website to learn more about me; it won’t disappoint: http://abhitej-bokka.github.io/

I attached my resume below and look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you,

Abhitej Bokka
